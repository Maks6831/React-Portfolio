The following is a portfolio made using React and Tailwind CSS. The project Showcase page displays 6 github repositories which are created dynamically using JSON data. If the user clicks on the read more they are moved to a page where the readme for the github repostory is rendered by fetching the md file from github and displaying using the Markdown to JSX package. The user can then interact with any links on the md file including links to the deployed application or simply click on the github link to see the full respository in github.
